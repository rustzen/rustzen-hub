# rustzen-hub Agent Guide

## Scope

`rustzen-hub` is the Rustzen web monorepo.

- `apps/site` owns the public website, product pages, download page, docs entry, and about page.
- `apps/console` owns the admin console, dashboard, product/release/license surfaces, billing hooks, and related APIs.
- `packages/*` is for shared assets only after a dependency is used across more than one app.

This repository replaces the old split between `rustzen/rzen-portal` and `rustzen/rzen-platform`.

## Start Every Task

1. Run `git status --short --branch` before edits, builds, tests, staging, commits, pushes, or deploys.
2. Read this file, then the nearest `AGENTS.md` under the app being changed.
3. Keep changes scoped to the requested app or package.
4. Preserve unrelated dirty work.
5. Use root workspace commands or package scripts from the relevant `package.json`; do not invent checks.

## Boundaries

- Do not put public marketing/product pages in `apps/console`.
- Do not put admin-only pages, API route ownership, secrets, or Prisma changes in `apps/site`.
- Do not extract shared packages before both apps actually need the shared surface.
- Do not commit `.env`, `.env.local`, `.vercel/`, `.next/`, `.astro/`, `dist/`, `out/`, or `node_modules/`.
- Production deploy, Vercel environment changes, database changes, and webhook tests require explicit approval.

## Commands

Use pnpm from the repository root:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm lint
pnpm --filter @rustzen/site build
pnpm --filter @rustzen/console lint
pnpm --filter @rustzen/console build
```

Use `/private/tmp/pnpm-store` for dependency installs when running Codex-managed pnpm installs on this machine.

## Reporting

When reporting work, include:

- current branch and dirty-tree summary;
- changed files by app/package;
- commands run and results;
- what is verified versus not verified;
- any deployment, environment, database, or webhook risks.
