# ChatGPT external review record

Status: Experimental browser-mediated review  
Artifact visibility: local-private, untracked  
Repository: `/Users/daibin/Projects/repo-github/rustzen-hub`  
Branch at review start: `docs/public-identity-links`  
Conversation attribution: ChatGPT Project `AI Review`, conversation ending `1976`  
Input package: `review-package.md` (8,097 bytes, SHA-256 `6f6f47ef4c94c5318e945e53ece18f1e324d0bc42d9a0b3f9d1f498d6a1b9b00`)

## Round 1 — Feasibility and boundary correction

Completion evidence: stable Project conversation URL, response generation completed, full response extracted from the assistant message.  
Verdict: `needs changes`.

Material findings:

- Reject one `rustzen-platform` runtime for Admin, Analytics, Inspect, and Report.
- Do not create `rustzen-platform` or `rustzen-desktop` yet.
- Preserve public/internal visibility and independent deployment/rollback boundaries.
- Treat Desktop as a product and entitlement family, not yet a Git boundary.
- Retain `rustzen-core` provisionally and audit consumers/API compatibility before shrinking it.
- Measure recurring maintenance and coupling instead of repository count.

Codex verification: confirmed against current project map, engineering standards, child `AGENTS.md`, architecture docs, manifests, and live Git state.

## Round 2 — Adversarial architecture and migration review

Completion evidence: same conversation, response generation completed, DOM response captured.  
Verdict: `needs changes`.

Material findings:

- Inventory protected runtime/deployment contracts before standardization.
- Define SQLite schema ownership, readers/writers, retention, backup, restore, downgrade, and corruption recovery per product.
- Version entitlement independently from signing/updater/release identities.
- Keep a single authoritative source during cross-repository work.
- Pin shared CI/tooling immutably, without portfolio-wide release authority.
- Separate `rustzen-core` admission, continued maintenance, and published API removal.
- Require quantitative eligibility evidence before any monorepo proof of concept.

Codex verification: findings match repository rules and protected contracts; incorporated into the RFC draft.

## Round 3 — Final RFC acceptance review

Input: `rustzen-portfolio-plan.md`, original SHA-256 `9e118b7835388b906cf6682bba21f8ec621159852831a857849eafe7f26194ac`. The browser converted the pasted Markdown into exactly one attachment; attachment state was verified before submit.  
Completion evidence: same conversation, completed response, response controls present.  
Verdict: `needs changes`.

Remaining findings:

- Source SHA selection conflicted with an unconditional `origin/main` worktree base.
- Cutover and archive sequencing placed rollback-window expiry before cutover.
- Six repositories lacked an exact source-SHA validation-command registry.
- Candidate-critical `Not verified` contracts could reach structural proof-of-concept work.
- Candidate thresholds were not required to be fixed before measuring pilot results.
- Two successful pilots did not justify blanket portfolio adoption.

Codex disposition: all six findings were locally verified and corrected in `rustzen-portfolio-plan.md`. No fourth external review was authorized or performed, so the external final verdict remains `needs changes`; the amended RFC is locally ready for a future independent closeout review.
